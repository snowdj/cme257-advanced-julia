    "## What is Julia?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) is a relatively new language designed for scientific computing.  You'll find similarities to MATLAB and Python, but will also find differences.  It is rapidly gaining popularity in the scientific computing community (for example, its optimization pacakges are very popular).  Stanford has its fair share of users and contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some features (see [julialang.org](http://julialang.org/)):\n",
    "* just-in-time compiliation (JIT)\n",
    "* parallelism and distributed execution\n",
    "* call python and C (and other languages!)\n",
    "* macros and metaprogramming\n",
    "* multiple dispatch functions (overload for different argument type combinations)\n",
    "* dynamic type system (user-defined types perform well)\n",
    "* built on LLVM\n"

    "## Why use Julia?\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is designed to balance two goals\n",
    "* Ease of programming\n",
    "* Speed of execution\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you can get near C/Fortran-like performance, with the programming effort of MATLAB or Python.  Julias tries to incorporate the best features of a variety of languages\n",
    "\n",
    "* General purpose code reads like Python\n",
    "* Linear algebra looks like MATLAB\n",
    "* Macros give Lisp-like abilities\n",
    "* Loops give speed like C/Fortran\n",
    "* Statistics looks like R (see Dataframes, Distributions pacakages)\n",
    "\n",
    "To see a performance comparison, see [here](https://julialang.org/benchmarks/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other reasons:\n",
    "* Open-source (MIT license)\n",
    "* Built with scientific computing in mind\n",
    "* Built with parallelism and distribution in mind\n",
    "* Performance ([julia's figure](http://julialang.org/benchmarks/))\n",
    "* Packages (built-in package manager)\n",
    "* Easy to call complied libraries, python\n",
    "* Supports multiple programming paradigms (OO, functional)\n",
    "* You can have an impact!\n",

    "* Nothing is hidden: if you ever want to hear about every little detail, you can ask.\n",
