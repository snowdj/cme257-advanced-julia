### Syntax

1. How do you assign a variable?
2. How do you make a comment?
3. If you assign variable x, and then set y=x, what happens to y when you change the value of x?
4. How can you print a statement?
5. How can you print the contents of a variable?
6. What is the syntax for a for-loop?
7. What is the syntax for if-else statements?
8. How would you write a function that takes inputs x and y and returns x+2*y?

### Files

9. How would you load a file? (try class1.csv) (You may need to import a package for this.)
10. How would you run a script? (try class1.jl)
11. How can you print to a file?

### Arrays

12. How would you create an array?  What are some operations you may wish to perform?  Do array indices begin with 1 or 0?
13. Create a 10x10 random matrix A, a 1x10 random vector b, and solve the linear system Ax = b.
14. Allocate a 3x4 array of Int64 (don't initialize)

### Packages

16. Where can you find a listing of Julia packages installed on the system?
17. How can you add a Julia package?
18. Add the Plots package, and plot y=x^2 for x in [0,10].
