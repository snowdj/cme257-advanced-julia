# Worksheet 1: Types

1. What happens if you try to instantiate a cme257int with a float?  Why did this happen?

2. Create a type called "cme257OrderedPair" with the following properties:
    1. It is a child of cme257abstract
    2. It has two fields: "a" and "b"
    3. The fields "a" and "b" are the same parameterized type
    
3. How do you create a Complex number in Julia?  Investigate the resulting type:
    1. Is it a primitive type?  If not, what fields does it have?
    2. What else do you notice?  Is it immutable?  Is it parameterized?
