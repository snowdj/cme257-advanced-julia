    "One of the nice things about Julia is that it is relatively easy to use code written in other languages.  Today we'll talk about Julia's built-in [`ccall()`](http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/) function (for C and Fortran) as well as the [PyCall](https://github.com/stevengj/PyCall.jl) package.  There are also packages to call [R](https://github.com/JuliaStats/RCall.jl), [Matlab](https://github.com/JuliaLang/MATLAB.jl), [Mathematica](https://github.com/one-more-minute/Mathematica.jl), [C++](https://github.com/Keno/Cxx.jl), and [Java](https://github.com/aviks/JavaCall.jl) (maybe more that aren't on the package registry).  We'll focus on ccall and PyCall today because these are probably the most important in the current Julia ecosystem, although you may find one of these other packages useful depending on your needs and interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why call other languages?\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia can be nice to work with, but isn't perfectly suited for all problems, and hasn't been around for a long time to gain extensive package support.  Using language interfaces can let you\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Julia for certain tasks, and use a different language for other tasks\n",
    "* Utilize robust, tried and tested libraries, or industry/community standard libraries\n",
    "* Use code from your old projects in Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "## ccall\n",
    "\n",
    "`ccall()` lets you call libraries written in either in c or fortran from Julia.  Shared object libraries vary a bit between operating systems - typically on linux they have a .so extension, Macs have a .dylib extension, and Windows has a .dll extension.  Static libraries have a .a extension on Mac/linux, and .lib extension on Windows.  The examples here were tested on linux machines (Elementary OS, Fedora, and Ubuntu), so if you may find it easier to follow along on corn@stanford.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shared object libraries are loaded at runtime, and static libraries have code that is copied when a binary is created.  You can only call shared object libraries from Julia.  If you want to learn more, try this [StackOverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2649334/difference-between-static-and-shared-libraries) to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiling a library\n",
    "\n",
    "When you install a library using a package manager, it's pretty easy to get started using it.  If you have your own custom code, you need to pass in `-fPIC` and `-shared` to your compiler (at least gcc, other compilers may behave slightly differently) to help the complier know it is creating a shared object library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll use C to compile libraries, but you can also use fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the [Makefile](Makefile) to see a basic example.\n",

    "### Using ccall\n",
