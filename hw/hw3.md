In this homework you'll create an IJulia notebook that explores a package, and add it to the class GitHub repository so that others can see what you discovered.

---

## Part 1 - Explore a Package
Choose a Julia package that interests you.  Create an IJulia notebook that introduces the class to the package, and contains the following:
* What version of Julia you used when creating the notebook
* What packages you use in the notebook (and any nonstandard information needed to run it)
* Demonstrate some of the basic features of the package.
* Include an interesting example or two (consider using interact, or create cool figure, or use it on a real world dataset)
* Make sure to include commentary on what you are doing.

## Part 2 - Share Your Notebook
Add your package to the course GitHub repository.
* Create a GitHub account if you have not already done so
* Fork the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/icme/cme257-advanced-julia), and clone the fork on your computer.
* Put your notebook in the [packages directory](https://github.com/icme/cme257-advanced-julia/tree/master/packages)
* Name your notebook "packagename.ipynb" (where packagename is replaced by the package you explored)
* commit your changes, push your changes to your fork to GitHub, then create a pull request to merge your changes to the original course repository
